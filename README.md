# Introduction
Load status prediction is a critical task in various fields such as energy management, manufacturing, and logistics. This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient prediction model using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

# Features

- Data Handling: 
Using numpy and pandas for efficient data manipulation.

- Visualization: 
Using seaborn for insightful data visualization.

- Model Building: 
Using scikit-learn to build and train the SVM model.

- Performance Evaluation: 
Measuring model accuracy with accuracy_score.

# Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

- git clone https://github.com/SachinMaurya2002/Loan-Status-Prediction-Using-the-Machine-Learning.git

- cd load-status-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Follow the steps below to use the model:

- Prepare your data: 
Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).

- Load the data: 
Use the provided scripts to load and preprocess your data.

- Train the model: 
Run the training script to build the SVM model.

- Evaluate the model: 
Use the evaluation script to check the accuracy of the model.


- Example command:

- python train.py --data_path data/your_dataset.csv
